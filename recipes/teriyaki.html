        <h2>What is Chicken Teriyaki?</h2>
        <p>Teriyaki chicken is simply chicken that is coated in teriyaki sauce.</p>
        <p>The dish comes from the Japanese cooking technique called teriyaki, where
            meat is grilled or broiled with a soy sauce, mirin, and sugar glaze.
            Today, teriyaki chicken refers to any chicken with teriyaki sauce.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon corn starch</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cold water</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>12 boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Combine sugar, soy sauce, cider vinegar, cornstarch, cold water, ginger,
                and pepper in a small saucepan over low heat. Simmer, stirring frequently,
                until sauce thickens and bubbles, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat. </li>
            <li>Place chicken thighs in the prepared baking dish. Brush both sides of each
                thigh with the sauce. Reserve any extra sauce for basting.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip chicken and brush with sauce. Continue to bake, basting with
                remaining sauce every 10 minutes, until no longer pink and juices run
                clear, 20 to 30 more minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        </ol>
