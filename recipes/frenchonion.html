        <h2>What is French Onion Soup?</h2>
        <p>French onion soup is a classic French dish made with caramelized onions
            and beef stock or broth. The soup is topped with bread and cheese,
            then gratineed to rich, gooey perfection. It's traditionally served in
            a ramekin or a crock.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>4 cups sliced onions</li>
            <li>5 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dry sherry</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>4 slices french bread</li>
            <li>4 slices provolone</li>
            <li>2 slices swiss</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated parmesan</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter with olive oil in an 8-quart stock pot over medium
                heat. Add onions and continually stir until tender and
                translucent. Do not brown the onions.</li>
            <li>Add beef broth, sherry, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper.
                Let simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
            <li>Ladle souop into oven-safe serving bowls and place one slice of
                bread on top of each (bread may be broken into pieces if you 
                prefer). Layer each slice of bread with a slice of provolone, 1/2
                slice diced Swiss and 1 tablespoon Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Place bowls on a cookie sheet and broil in the preheated oven until
                cheese bubbles and browns slightly, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
